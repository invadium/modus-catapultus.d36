# Modus Catapultus - Ludum Dare 36 Edition

This is a game prototype created for Ludum Dare 36.

It is very significant for me, since contains
first mockups of what later will become [Collider.JAM Game Framework](http://collider.land).

The [Dare Toolbox](https://github.com/invadium/dare-toolbox/tree/master) was used to establish this project.
Couple of jams later it will evolve into the early versions of Collider.JAM.
